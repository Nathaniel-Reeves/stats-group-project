# Stats Group Project

## Important Note!
Please remember to write your code in such a way that we can do a simple data file swap to compare different years.  We could answer the question, "Are cars safer today than they were in 2000?" much easier if our code is responsive and adaptable.  The columns for each data file should be consistant, however is they arn't then we will just skip that comparison.  

## Presentation
Each of us will present our own data, code, and results in a single google slides document.  Add the results you get to your slides as you go.  Keep the slides short and dont use too many.  Here is the link to the slides file - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vtjl48Y_-QiRcFZHMxzkQnZgr-ZYvC6rcPebPHHMmVo/edit#slide=id.p

## Data
Data is already uploaded for both 2020 and 2000 in the data folder.  Column descriptions are availble on the project preposal google doc - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IxfPSOUbbOqqe6f04rqDRJWzSzsw7vlkgBry313jUm8/edit#
